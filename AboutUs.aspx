            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<p> Twitter (/ˈtwɪtər/) is an online social networking service that enables 
            users to send and read short 140-character messages called &quot;tweets&quot;. button. 
            Registered users can read and post tweets, but unregistered users can only read 
            them. Users access Twitter through the website interface, SMS, or mobile device 
            app. Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco and has more than 25 offices around 
            the world. Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz 
            Stone, and Noah Glass and launched in July 2006. The service rapidly gained 
            worldwide popularity, with more than 100 million users who posted 340 million 
            tweets per day in 2012. The service also handled 1.6 billion search queries per 
            day. In 2013, Twitter was one of the ten most-visited websites and has been 
            described as &quot;the SMS of the Internet&quot;. As of May 2015, Twitter has more than 
            500 million users, out of which more than 302 million are active users.</p></div>
            <div class="style2">
                <p>Twitter&#39;s origins lie in a &quot;daylong brainstorming session&quot; held by board members 
                of the podcasting company Odeo. Jack Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at 
                New York University, introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service 
                to communicate with a small group. The original project code name for the 
                service was twttr, an idea that Williams later ascribed to Noah Glass, inspired 
                by Flickr and the five-character length of American SMS short codes. The 
                decision was also partly due to the fact that domain twitter.com was already in 
                use, and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the 
                domain and changed the name of the service to Twitter. The developers initially 
                considered &quot;10958&quot; as a short code, but later changed it to &quot;40404&quot; for &quot;ease of 
                use and memorability&quot;. Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when 
                Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM Pacific Standard Time 
                (PST): &quot;just setting up my twttr&quot;. Dorsey has explained the origin of the 
                &quot;Twitter&quot; title:...we came across the word &#39;twitter&#39;, and it was just perfect. 
                The definition was &#39;a short burst of inconsequential information,&#39; and &#39;chirps 
                from birds&#39;. And that&#39;s exactly what the product was.</p>
                <h4>Growth Of Twitter</h4>
                <p>The company experienced rapid growth. It had 400,000 tweets posted per quarter in 
                    2007. This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008. In February 
                    2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.[35] By March 2010, 
                    the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications. As of June 2010, about 
                    65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each 
                    second, according to Twitter. As of March 2011, that was about 140 million 
                    tweets posted daily. As noted on Compete.com, Twitter moved up to the 
                    third-highest-ranking social networking site in January 2009 from its previous 
                    rank of twenty-second.</p>
